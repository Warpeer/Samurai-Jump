# Samurai Jump

### This is my first game created using the HTML Canvas Element.

## Known bugs/errors:
    -Platforms not initializing.
    -Game starts while in menu.
    -Game is slowmotion if playing with less than 144hz.
    -Game is only playable on monitors bigger than 1024x1200px.

## Important:
    For the best user experience please play the game with a 144hz refresh rate.
    This is the only playable refreshrate as I've not yet added implementations
    for this bug.
